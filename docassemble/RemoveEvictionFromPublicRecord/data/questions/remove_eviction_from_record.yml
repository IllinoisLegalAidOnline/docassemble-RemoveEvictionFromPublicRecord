  Remove eviction from public record
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Remove eviction from public record** Easy Form.
  
  This program helps you ask a judge to remove an eviction court file from the public record so it does not show up in a background check or credit report. This program makes a *Motion to Remove Eviction Court File from Public Record*.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article, [**What happens if I have an eviction on my record?**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/what-happens-if-i-have-eviction-my-record)
field: sees_nav_bar

  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need a copy of your eviction court case papers. If an **{Eviction Order}** was entered against you, it will have the information you need.

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

question: |
  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your *Motion to Remove Eviction Court File from Public Record*, you must file it with the court. This program does not file your forms for you.
  
  You may need to schedule a court date for when the judge will hear your motion. The scheduling process is different depending on your location and case type. Check with your [**local circuit clerk**](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-clerks/) for how to schedule a motion hearing.
  
  Finally, you will need to send your *Motion to Remove Eviction Court File from Public Record* and *Notice of Court Date for Motion* forms to other parties in your case or their lawyers, if they have them.
  
  To learn more, read the instructions you can download at the end of this program.

question: |
  Are you the tenant or the landlord?
subquestion: |
  If you are listed as a defendant in the *Eviction Order* or other court papers, you should click **Tenant**.
  
  If you are listed as a plaintiff in the *Eviction Order* or other court papers, you should click **Landlord**.

question: |
  Have you contacted the other parties about removing the eviction from the public record?
subquestion: |
  It may be helpful if the parties have agreed to remove the eviction court file from the public record. 

  An agreement is not required. You can ask the judge even if there is no agreement.

  Have any of the other parties told you they object to removing the court file from the public record?
subquestion: |
  Only select **Yes** if they said they are going to fight removing your court file from the public record.
  
  If they have not said anything or if you do not know, select **No**.

question: |
  % if party_label == "defendant":
  Were you evicted because the building you were living in was foreclosed on?
  % else:
  Was the eviction filed because the building the defendant was living in foreclosed on?
  % endif
subquestion: |
  % if party_label == "defendant":
  A foreclosure is a forced sale of a property. If a bank became the building's owner because the landlord could not pay their loan to the bank, that means the building was foreclosed on.
  
  If your landlord chose to sell the building, that means the building was not foreclosed on.
  
  % endif
  If a foreclosure was filed but was later dismissed, you should click **No** here.

question: |
  Legal basis for removing an eviction
subquestion: |
  The eviction court file **may** be removed from the public record if:
  
  * The eviction is without a basis in fact or law, and
  * It is more important to keep the eviction record from the public than letting the public see it.
  
  The judge will decide whether to remove the eviction from the public record. 
  
  ${collapse_template(about_mistake)}
---
template: about_mistake
subject: |
  **What makes an eviction "without a basis in fact or law?"**
content: |
  The two most common reasons an eviction can have no basis are:
  
  * The landlord had no reason to file the eviction, or
  * The renter was not properly served with an eviction notice or summons and a copy of the eviction complaint.
  
  % if party_label == "defendant":
  There are other ways a renter can argue that an eviction has no basis. For example, the renter may have moved out after the eviction was filed, making the eviction moot, or the landlord may have accepted court-based rental assistance.
  % else:
  If you have changed your mind about the eviction or the situation has been resolved and you no longer think that this should be public record, you can list that as a reason why the eviction does not have basis in fact or law.
  % endif

   This program will allow you to write your own reason the eviction is without basis.  However, the judge will decide whether the eviction is without basis. If you do not know if your eviction had no basis, you may want to talk with a lawyer about the eviction.

id: interest of justice
question: |
  What makes it fair to remove this eviction from the public record?
subquestion: |
  Most court cases are kept in the public record. Sometimes it is unfair to the parties in a case to keep the court file open to the public. The law requires you give reasons why it is more important to keep the eviction record from the public than letting the public see it.
  
  You will be able to explain your answer and give details on the next screen.

  About the court hearing
subquestion: |
  At the hearing, most courts will use the word **seal** instead of **remove**. Some courts may use the word **impound**. You may want to use the word the court uses, if you know it.

  Background checks
subquestion: |
  If you remove an eviction from the public record but it shows up later in a background check, your rights may have been violated. If that happens, you may want to speak to a lawyer or a consumer rights advocate.
  
  If you use your landlord as a reference, know that they can still give others information about the eviction.
  
  Removing an eviction from the public record does not undo the eviction or change any other court decisions.
