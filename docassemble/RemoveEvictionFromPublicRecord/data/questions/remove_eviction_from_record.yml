  Remove eviction from public record
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Remove eviction from public record** Easy Form.
  
  This program helps you ask a judge to remove an eviction court file from the public record so it does not show up in a background check or credit report. This program makes a *Motion to Remove Eviction Court File from Public Record*.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article, [**What happens if I have an eviction on my record?**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/what-happens-if-i-have-eviction-my-record)
field: sees_nav_bar

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need a copy of your eviction court case papers. If an **{Eviction Order}** was entered against you, it will have the information you need.

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

question: |
  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your *Motion to Remove Eviction Court File from Public Record*, you must file it with the court. This program does not file your forms for you.
  
  You may need to schedule a motion hearing for the judge to hear your motion. The scheduling process is different depending on your location and case type. Check with your [**local circuit clerk**](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-clerks/) for how to schedule a motion hearing.
  
  Finally, you will need to send your forms to the other parties. If someone has a lawyer, you only need to send it to their lawyer.
  
  To learn more, you can read and download the instructions at the end of this program.

id: contact other parties
question: |
  Have you contacted the other parties about removing the eviction from the public record?
subquestion: |
  It may be helpful if the parties have agreed to remove the eviction court file from the public record. 

  If everyone agrees with removing the eviction from public record, the judge may be more likely to remove it.

  An agreement is not required. You can ask the judge even if there is no agreement.

question: |
  Have any of the other parties told you they object to removing the court file from the public record?
subquestion: |

  Was the eviction filed because the building the defendant was living in was foreclosed on?
  % endif
subquestion: |
  A foreclosure is a forced sale of a property when the owner doesn't make payments on the loan for the property. The lender, usually a bank, can sue in court to get the property to pay back the loan. This type of lawsuit is called a foreclosure.

  If a foreclosure was filed but later dismissed, you should click **No**.

question: |
  Legal basis for removing an eviction
subquestion: |
  The eviction court file **may** be removed from the public record if:
  
  * The eviction is without a basis in fact or law, and
  * It is more important to keep the eviction record from the public than letting the public see it.
  
  The judge will decide whether to remove the eviction from the public record.

#if you update this template's content, be sure to also update the sufficiency check block's subquestion
template: about_mistake
subject: |
  **What makes an eviction "without a basis in fact or law?"**
content: |
  Some reasons an eviction can have no basis are:
  
  * The landlord had no reason to file the eviction, or
  * The renter was not properly served with an eviction notice or summons and a copy of the eviction complaint.
  
  % if party_label == "defendant":
  There are other ways an eviction might have no basis. For example, the renter may have moved out after the eviction was filed or the landlord may have accepted court-based rental assistance.
  % else:
  If you have changed your mind about the eviction or the situation has been resolved and you no longer think that this should be public record, you can list that.
  % endif

   You can write your own reasons why the eviction is without basis.  However, the judge will decide whether the eviction is without basis. If you do not know if your eviction had no basis, you may want to talk with a lawyer about the eviction.

id: interest of justice
question: |
  What makes it fair to remove this eviction from the public record?
subquestion: |
  Most court cases are kept in the public record. Sometimes it is unfair to the parties in a case to keep the court file open to the public. The law requires you give reasons why it is more important to keep the eviction record from the public than letting the public see it.

  * Having the eviction in the public record makes it hard for me to find new housing. I have been unable to rent an apartment due to the record of this eviction.
  % else:
  * Removing this eviction from public record would help the tenant find other housing more quickly and make my unit available for a new tenant.
  * Both sides believe it is in the best interest for tenant to move. Removing the case from public record would prevent further litigation.

subquestion: |
  If you remove an eviction from the public record but it shows up later in a background check, your rights may have been violated. If that happens, you may want to speak to a lawyer or a consumer rights advocate.
  
  If you use your landlord as a reference, know that they can still give others information about the eviction.
  
  Removing an eviction from the public record does not undo the eviction or change any other court decisions in the eviction case.
